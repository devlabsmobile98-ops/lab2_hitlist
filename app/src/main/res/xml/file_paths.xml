This file is required for the FileProvider declared in AndroidManifest.xml. It defines
the specific paths that your app is allowed to share with other apps (like the camera app).
Exposing specific directories like this is a modern security requirement in Android.

<paths>

    This 'files-path' entry corresponds to the directory returned by `context.getFilesDir()`.
    - name="my_images": A logical, internal name for this shareable path.
    - path="images/": Specifies that we can share files within the 'images' subdirectory of our
                      app's private files directory. This must match the path used in TaskDetailActivity.
