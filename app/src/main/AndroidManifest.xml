The manifest file is the control center of your Android application. It provides essential
information about your app to the Android build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play.
It declares the app's components, required permissions, hardware/software features, and more.

        Declaration for the Homepage activity. This is your main task list screen.
        'android:name=".Homepage"' specifies the class for this activity.
        'android:exported="false"' means this activity cannot be launched by other apps,
        which is a good security practice for internal screens.

        Declaration for the MainActivity. This is your initial splash/entry screen.
        'android:exported="true"' is required because it contains the LAUNCHER intent-filter,
        making it discoverable and launchable by the user from the home screen.

            The <intent-filter> tells the system what kinds of intents this activity can handle.
            ACTION_MAIN: This is the main entry point of the application.
            CATEGORY_LAUNCHER: This makes the activity appear in the top-level app launcher.

        Declaration for the TaskDetailActivity. This is the screen for creating and editing tasks.
        By registering it here, you make the Android system aware of its existence, allowing
        it to be launched via an Intent from other activities like Homepage.
        'android:exported="false"' is used because this screen is only intended to be opened
        from within your own app.
